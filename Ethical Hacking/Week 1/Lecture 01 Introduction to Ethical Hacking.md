## ‚úÖ **Lecture Summary: Introduction to Ethical Hacking**

This lecture introduces the concept of **ethical hacking**, its importance, scope, and how it differs from malicious hacking. It also touches upon relevant terminology, types of attacks, testing approaches, and legal concerns. The course will cover core concepts in networking, cryptography, and tools used for penetration testing.

## üß† **What is Ethical Hacking?**

- **Definition**: The _legal_ process of identifying vulnerabilities in systems by simulating the actions of malicious hackers.
- **Objective**: Find and fix security weaknesses before they are exploited.
- **Synonyms**:
    
    - Penetration Testing
    - Intrusion Testing
    - Red Teaming

---

## üîß **Roles of Ethical Hackers**

- Hired by companies to simulate attacks and provide vulnerability reports.
- Use hacking tools to test systems.
- Mimic real-world attackers _legally_ and _with permission_.

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è **Penetration Testing**

- Simulated attack to check for exploitable vulnerabilities.
- Ends with a **report**, not necessarily a solution.
- For solutions ‚Üí **Security Testing** (includes policy review, patch recommendations).

---

## üí¨ **Important Terminologies**

|Term|Definition|
|---|---|
|**Hacking**|Skillful breaking into systems to gain unauthorized access.|
|**Cracking**|Breaching the security of systems, software, or networks.|
|**Spoofing**|Falsifying identity (e.g., faking IP address).|
|**Denial of Service (DoS)**|Flooding a server with requests to make it slow or unusable.|
|**Port Scanning**|Identifying open ports in a system to find vulnerabilities.|

---

## üîê **Ways of Gaining Access**

1. **Front Door**: Legitimate access via stolen/guessed credentials.
2. **Back Door**: Hidden access left by developers (often for debugging).
3. **Trojan Horses**: Malicious code hidden in trusted software.
4. **Software Vulnerabilities**: Known bugs in software used by "script kiddies" for easy exploits.

---

## üïµÔ∏è **Post-Hacking Actions**

- Erase logs to cover tracks.
- Steal or destroy files.
- Modify content (e.g., website defacement).
- Install backdoors for future access.
- Use one compromised system to attack others in the network.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª **Types of Hackers**

- **Script Kiddies**: Inexperienced hackers using publicly available scripts.
- **Experienced Penetration Testers**: Use custom tools/scripts in languages like Python, Perl, C/C++.

---

## üíº **Testing Approaches**

|Model|Description|
|---|---|
|**White Box**|Full network information provided to tester.|
|**Black Box**|No information given; tester must discover everything.|
|**Gray Box**|Partial information is given. Most practical scenario.|

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Legal & Ethical Considerations**

- Laws vary by country ‚Äî always check _local regulations_.
- Some tools may be **illegal** in certain jurisdictions.
- **Examples of illegal actions** (even during testing):
    
    - Unauthorized access to a system
    - Installing malware
    - Performing DoS attacks
    - Blocking users/customers from using services

---

## üß∞ **Skills & Tools Required**

- Strong **networking and computer fundamentals**
- Knowledge of **cryptography**
- **Communication skills** for team collaboration
- Legal awareness
- Access to **Tiger Box** (a portable device preloaded with testing tools and OSes)

---

## üìö **Course Coverage Outline**

1. **Networking Concepts** (fundamental to understanding tools)
2. **Cryptographic Techniques** (used for securing systems)
3. **Secure Application Case Studies**
4. **Unconventional Attacks** (e.g., hardware-based)
5. **Tool Demonstrations** (real-world attack simulations)

## üìù Key Takeaways

- Ethical hacking is about **protecting systems**, not harming them.
- It's a **legal process** backed by organizational permission.
- **Penetration testing** is a core technique.
- Always be aware of the **laws of your country** or organization.
- A mix of **technical skills, tools, and ethics** is needed to become a good ethical hacker.
