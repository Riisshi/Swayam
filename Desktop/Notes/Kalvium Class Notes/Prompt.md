"I will give you a learning unit (lesson content). Do two things: Convert it into clear, concise, well-structured study notes. Use headings, bullet points, and emojis/icons for readability. Summarize definitions, concepts, syntax, and examples. Add a short ‘Summary/Key Takeaways’ section at the end. Keep it simple but complete for proper revision. After the study notes, create a super concise cheat sheet. Only the most essential points. Quick-glance format (1–2 min revision). Minimal code snippets, only if absolutely necessary."
